Helped organize the *Paving Pathways Career Symposium*, a half-day event focused on navigating diverse career paths in and beyond academia. The symposium brought together postdoctoral scholars and early-career researchers for panels, workshops and discussions with professionals from academia, industry and science communication.

Held at the University at Buffalo, the event featured speakers from across the SUNY system and beyond. It was a fantastic opportunity to foster community, share resources, and inspire conversations around professional development.
