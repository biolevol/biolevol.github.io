Our latest preprint, **_Convergent evolution through independent rearrangements in the primate amylase locus_**, is now available. We explore how independent gene duplications, driven by structural instability and non-allelic homologous recombination, have shaped amylase copy number across diverse primate lineages. 

Read the full preprint [here](https://doi.org/10.1101/2025.08.14.670395).
