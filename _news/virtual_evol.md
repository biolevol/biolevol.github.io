I had the pleasure of presenting two talks at this year’s *Virtual Evolution 2025* meeting.  

1. *Human Amylase Evolution* - Highlighting recent work on recurrent duplications at the *AMY1* locus.  
2. *Primate Structural Variation* – Presenting new findings into the convergent evolution of salivary amylase through independent rearrangements in primates.

Grateful for the opportunity to share our work!
