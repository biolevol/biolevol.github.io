***Why this locus? Recurrent duplications and extensive structural polymorphism at the amylase locus in humans and non-human primates.***

I had the fantastic opportunity to present at the 2025 Gordon Research Conference (GRC) on Ecological and Evolutionary Genomics in Lucca, Italy.  
My talk focused on the evolutionary mechanisms driving structural variation, highlighting recent findings on amylase gene duplications and their functional implications across primates.
