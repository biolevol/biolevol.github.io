               genetic variation in Drosophila subobscura. Presently, the
               species is experiencing a rapid replacement of high-latitude by
               low-latitude inversions associated with global warming. Yet not
               all low-latitude inversions are correlated with the ongoing
               warming trend. This is particularly unexpected in the case of O7
               because it shows a regular seasonal cycle that peaks in summer
               and rose with a heatwave. The inconsistent behavior of O7 across
               components of the ambient temperature suggests that is causally
               more complex than simply due to temperature alone. In order to
               understand the dynamics of O7, high-quality genomic data are
               needed to determine both the breakpoints and the genetic content.
               To fill this gap, here we generated a PacBio long read-based
               chromosome-scale genome assembly, from a highly homozygous line
               made isogenic for an O3 + 4 + 7 chromosome. Then we isolated the
               complete continuous sequence of O7 by conserved synteny analysis
               with the available reference genome. Main findings include the
               following: (i) the assembled O7 inversion stretches 9.936 Mb,
               containing > 1,000 annotated genes; (ii) O7 had a complex origin,
               involving multiple breaks associated with non-B DNA-forming
               motifs, formation of a microinversion, and ectopic repair in
               trans with the two homologous chromosomes; (iii) the O7
               breakpoints carry a pre-inversion record of fragility, including
               a sequence insertion, and transposition with later inverted
               duplication of an Attacin immunity gene; and (iv) the O7
               inversion relocated the major insulin signaling forkhead box
               subgroup O (foxo) gene in tight linkage with its antagonistic
               regulatory partner serine/threonine-protein kinase B (Akt1) and
               disrupted concerted evolution of the two inverted Attacin
               duplicates, reattaching them to dFOXO metabolic enhancers. Our
               findings suggest that O7 exerts antagonistic pleiotropic effects
               on reproduction and immunity, setting a framework to understand
               its relationship with climate change. Furthermore, they are
               relevant for fragility in genome rearrangement evolution and for
               current views on the contribution of breakage versus repair in
               shaping inversion-breakpoint junctions.",

               in evolutionary genetics. Presently, its use is hindered by the
               lack of a reference genome. To bridge this gap, here we used
               PacBio long-read technology, together with the available wealth
               of genetic marker information, to assemble and annotate a
               high-quality nuclear and complete mitochondrial genome for the
               species. With the obtained assembly, we performed the first
               synteny analysis of genome structure evolution in the subobscura
               subgroup. RESULTS: We generated a highly-contiguous ~ 129 Mb-long
               nuclear genome, consisting of six pseudochromosomes corresponding
               to the six chromosomes of a female haploid set, and a complete
               15,764 bp-long mitogenome, and provide an account of their

               All 12 identified paracentric inversion differences in the

               and repair, with some associated duplications, but no evidence of

              recognized as engines of evolutionary convergence due to their
              propensity to generate recurrent gene duplications that give rise
              to similar gene expression patterns and traits across lineages.
              However the mutational mechanisms driving these duplications and
              the regulatory changes enabling novel expression patterns remain
              poorly understood. The primate amylase locus, marked by
              independent gene duplications, provides an ideal model to
              investigate these dynamics. Leveraging high-quality genome
              assemblies from 53 primates and multi-tissue transcriptomes from
              Old World monkeys, we reconstructed the evolutionary history of
              the recurrent gene duplications across the primate phylogeny. Our
              data suggest that lineage-specific LTR retrotransposon insertions
              are associated with initial structural instability, while
              subsequent duplications are primarily driven by non-allelic
              homologous recombination. Recurrent independent duplications in
              rhesus macaques, olive baboons, and great apes gave rise to
              distinct amylase gene copies with convergent expression in the
              pancreas and salivary glands. We found that these independent gene
              duplications are accompanied by episodic diversifying selection on
              lineage-specific copies, likely driving the emergence of
              functional divergence. Our comparative analyses in primates
              indicate that the gene ancestral to great ape AMY1 and AMY2A was
              expressed in both salivary glands and pancreas in the Catarrhini
              ancestor. The great ape-specific duplication of this ancestral
              gene likely facilitated subfunctionalization into salivary gland-
              and pancreas-specific expression, respectively. Comparative
              analysis of primate amylase promoter regions reveals regulatory
              rewiring, driven by motif turnover mediated by structural
              rearrangements, and partially explaining evolutionary shifts in
              expression. Together, our findings highlight how structural and
              regulatory modularity in complex genomic regions drives
              evolutionary innovation and molecular convergence, and we provide
              a genomic framework for dissecting these processes across diverse

  abstract  = "Phlebotomine sand flies are of global significance as important
               vectors of human disease, transmitting bacterial, viral, and
               protozoan pathogens, including the kinetoplastid parasites of the
               genus Leishmania, the causative agents of devastating diseases
               collectively termed leishmaniasis. More than 40 pathogenic
               Leishmania species are transmitted to humans by approximately 35
               sand fly species in 98 countries with hundreds of millions of
               people at risk around the world. No approved efficacious vaccine
               exists for leishmaniasis and available therapeutic drugs are
               either toxic and/or expensive, or the parasites are becoming
               resistant to the more recently developed drugs. Therefore, sand
               fly and/or reservoir control are currently the most effective
               strategies to break transmission. To better understand the
               biology of sand flies, including the mechanisms involved in their
               vectorial capacity, insecticide resistance, and population
               structures we sequenced the genomes of two geographically
               widespread and important sand fly vector species: Phlebotomus
               papatasi, a vector of Leishmania parasites that cause cutaneous
               leishmaniasis, (distributed in Europe, the Middle East and North
               Africa) and Lutzomyia longipalpis, a vector of Leishmania
               parasites that cause visceral leishmaniasis (distributed across
               Central and South America). We categorized and curated genes
               involved in processes important to their roles as disease
               vectors, including chemosensation, blood feeding, circadian
               rhythm, immunity, and detoxification, as well as mobile genetic
               elements. We also defined gene orthology and observed
               micro-synteny among the genomes. Finally, we present the genetic
               diversity and population structure of these species in their
               respective geographical areas. These genomes will be a foundation
               on which to base future efforts to prevent vector-borne
               transmission of Leishmania parasites.",
